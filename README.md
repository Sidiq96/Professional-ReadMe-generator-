# Professional-ReadMe-generator

I'll be building a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input
I can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.
The task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package Links to an external site.. Review the Professional README Guide Links to an external site. as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.

## User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

* Create a command-line application that accepts user input.

* When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

* The title of my project
* Sections entitled:
- Description
- Table of Contents
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests
- Questions

* When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.

* When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

* When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

* When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

* When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

* When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
